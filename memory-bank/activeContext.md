# Active Context — Hôm Nay Xem Gì (24h Live Feed & Notification Engine)

## Current State
- The 24h Live Feed and Notification Engine are fully implemented, verified, and running live on `http://localhost:8080/`.
- **Feature 1: 24h Live Update Newfeed**:
  - Tab `⚡ Mới Cập Nhật 24h (32)` filters and shows recent updates sorted by delta timestamp.
  - Cards feature a glowing pill `⚡ [X phút/giờ trước]` on the thumbnail.
- **Feature 2: Notification & Watchlist Tracker**:
  - Header Bell `🔔` with unread count badge and pulse animation.
  - Notification popover listing new episodes for followed films.
  - Clicking any notification item opens the Theater Modal directly at that updated episode and marks the notification as read.
  - In the Theater Modal episode matrix, the new episode is highlighted with a `[MỚI]` badge.
  - Adding/removing films from watchlist dynamically manages notification updates.
- **Duration Badge Sanitization**:
  - Cleaned duration strings to strip verbose parenthetical annotations (e.g. `(đã trừ video gộp trùng; tổng cộng tất cả video: 6 giờ 41 phút)`).
  - Duration badges now display strictly the clean, non-duplicated total duration (e.g. `4 giờ 20 phút`).
  - Implemented `cleanDurationStr` in `app.js` and sanitized `data.js`.

- **Feature 3: YouTube 30-Minute Auto-Update Engine**:
  - Implemented `scripts/update_youtube_feed.py` and `.github/workflows/auto_update_youtube.yml`.
  - Configured 30-minute cron schedule (`*/30 * * * *`) with manual `workflow_dispatch` trigger.
  - Automatically fetches XML RSS feeds of 8 partner YouTube channels without API keys.
  - Detected and ingested 56 new films and 14 new episodes from live YouTube channels, expanding catalog from 1,564 to 1,620 films.
  - Enhanced `app.js` to render live fetched YouTube timestamps (`publishedAt` / `updatedAt`) directly into the 24h newfeed.
  - Puppeteer screenshots verified: `new_live_youtube_feed` and `theater_modal_new_film`.

- **Feature 4: 100% Real YouTube Publish Dates (Fixed Fake Mock Timestamps)**:
  - Eliminated simulated `timeDeltas` mock array entirely.
  - Implemented `formatRealTimeAgo(isoString)` to compute true elapsed time from actual YouTube ISO timestamps.
  - Updated `film_2` ("Đô Thị Dị Năng: SSS Bị Phong Ấn 99%...") with its exact YouTube publish date (`2026-11-06T12:15:21Z`), changing its badge from fake "15 phút trước" to accurate "4 ngày trước".
  - Recent updates feed and notifications now strictly show real timestamps (e.g. 14 giờ trước, 1 ngày trước, 4 ngày trước).
  - Cleaned any legacy mock notifications from localStorage.
- **Cache-Busting & Instant Update Enforcement**:
  - Added cache-busting version hashes to asset links in `index.html` (`data.js?v=2.1`, `app.js?v=2.1`, `style.css?v=2.1`).
  - Updated `vercel.json` to enforce `max-age=0, must-revalidate` across all routes.
  - Added schema version validation `20261111_v2_realtime` in `app.js` to automatically purge stale browser localStorage caches.

## Verification Completed
- End-to-end Puppeteer verification executed and passed:
  - Duration badge cleanup verified with 0 violations across all 1,564 films.
  - YouTube RSS feed crawler ran locally with 0 errors and successfully ingested 56 new films & 14 parts.
  - Idempotency test passed (0 duplicate commits when no new videos exist).
  - Real YouTube publish timestamps verified on `film_2` (`⚡ 4 ngày trước`) and today's new videos (`14 giờ trước`).
  - Notification Popover screenshot taken with 100% real dates (`notif_popover_real_dates`).
